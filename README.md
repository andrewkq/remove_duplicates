# remove_duplicates
R script for removing duplicate rows during meta-analysis coding.

This script is meant to be used in the meta-analysis pipeline after all citations have been gathered from online databases and combined into one excel file. Script will go row by row and remove any rows that are the exact same in the Title, Page Number, and Publication columns.

Repo includes an example dataset. You will need to change column names for your particular case.
